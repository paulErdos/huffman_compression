0. Find out where the hell execution starts

1. Check that the program is called correctly
	a. verify that the command was 
	(1) (2) (3) 
	1: /path/to/gst hzip.st 	//not in args list
	2: ./hzip.st			//not in args list
	3: -((c XOR u) OR d OR t)	
	4: input file
	5: output file OR nothing

BUILD A HUFFMAN TREE
A Huffman tree in a binary tree with two types of nodes:
* non-leaf nodes, which store
	the number of letters in all of their leaves
	a pointer to their parent node
	a pointer to their left child
	a pointer to their right child
* leaf nodes, which store
	a letter
	the number of times that letter has been seen
	a pointer to the parent node


2. Read in a file and make a frequency table

3. do part C to construct the Huffman Tree


pseudocode
#check for valid input
	if options aren't valid
		ObjectMemory quit: status.	
	try to open files
	if opening fails
		ObjectMemory quit: status.
